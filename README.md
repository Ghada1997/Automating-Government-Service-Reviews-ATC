Automating Government Service Reviews ATC: Exploring the effect of TL Approaches including General Domain Direct Fine-Tuning and DAPT.

## Notes About the Repository

This repository includes a Master's Thesis project and includes code for data preprocessing, modeling, validation, and evaluation.

### Code Structure
- Some parts of the code are provided as **full implementations**, especially those related to data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Other parts are provided as **functions or pseudocode** to illustrate logic and structure without exposing sensitive data.
- For simplicity and clarity, some cells contain only function definitions or key processing steps with descriptive comments instead of full implementations.

### Anonymization & Simplifications
- Certain values (e.g., dataset paths, file names, and sensitive parameters) have been **anonymized** using placeholders (e.g., `"#####"`).
- Parameters used in experiments (e.g., hyperparameters or output paths) may be replaced with empty strings or comments guiding where to insert values.
- These values, along with the output logs, are not shared publicly to protect data privacy and maintain reproducibility integrity for academic publication. However, they are available within the Thesis itself.

### Purpose
The code is meant to:
- Demonstrate the logic and workflow behind the experiments
- Allow researchers to understand and potentially reproduce results with minimal modification
